## Running the Bot

To run the bot, use the following command:

```bash
python bot.py
```

If youâ€™re using threading for Flask (or another server):

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    bot_thread = threading.Thread(target=bot.run, args=(TOKEN,))
    bot_thread.daemon = True
    bot_thread.start()
    print("Bot thread started")
    run_flask()  # If you're also using Flask
```

## Available Commands

- `!aide`: Shows a list of available commands.
- `!play[URL]`: Makes the bot join a voice channel and play a predefined song.

---

## Troubleshooting

- **Bot quits instantly**: Make sure **FFmpeg** is installed and added to your systemâ€™s PATH.
- **Music not playing**: Ensure **yt-dlp** and FFmpeg are configured properly.
- **FFmpeg error**: Verify FFmpeg is installed and its path is correctly set.
